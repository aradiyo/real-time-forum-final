problems :
- post creation is not real-time (if I open two browsers and created one post from first one, they other browser need to refresh in order to show post!), I want it to be real time without refresh!
- post creation is showing only Category, Content and time created, it doesnt show creator nickname ! I want to show createor nick name as well.
- if other user created a post, I cant comment on it ! please fix this
- I want Direct messages to be as a toggle show on click (and disable if logout or in authentication page (login or register))
- Online users doesn't show as green, please fix this to be green when they online and back to grey when it's offline!
- DM not working as intended : (messages are saved in database but not shown to user neither real time nor later when click on the user) & it not shown at all when refreshing the page!
- user registration and user login are case sensetive (for nickname and email), please fix this.
- if there is no posts yet, there is message shown as (Error loading posts: null is not an object (evaluating 'posts.forEach')), I want to change this message to (There is no posts yet, please create one!)
- these messages are shown in the terminal when running app (Error reading message: json: cannot unmarshal object into Go struct field Message.sender_id of type string
